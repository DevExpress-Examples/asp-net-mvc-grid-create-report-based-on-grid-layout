<p>This example demonstrates how to dynamically create a report based upon the GridView extension at runtime. This means that all filtering, sorting and grouping conditions selected in the grid are also applied in a report. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to create a report with all the necessary bands, bind it to a data source and adjust all the necessary options. You can use this approach if you need to display content of templated columns in your report or insert a report based on GridView to another report.<br />
As it is impossible to get the GridView extension state (its filtering, groping, sorting info), the Session is used to pass the last GridView state to the controller.</p><p><strong>See also:</strong><br />
